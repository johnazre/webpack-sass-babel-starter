# Webpack/SASS/Babel Starter

This is built for anything requiring Webpack. Sass is included, but not necessary.

A few options that could be built with this:
- Modular [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) with Typescript (just add `ts-loader`)
- [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)

To get started:

```
git clone https://github.com/johnazre/webpack-sass-babel-starter.git
cd webpack-sass-babel-starter
npm install
npm start
```
